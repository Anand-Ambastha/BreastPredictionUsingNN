## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates the application of neural networks for binary classification in medical diagnosis. The model analyzes various features of cell nuclei to classify breast tumors as either **malignant** or **benign**, potentially assisting in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.

The neural network is trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors based on computed features from digitized images.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset** from UCI ML Repository, which contains:
- **569 samples** of breast tissue
- **30 numerical features** computed from digitized images
- **2 classes**: Malignant (M ‚Üí 1) and Benign (B ‚Üí 0)

### Preprocessing Pipeline:
- Removed irrelevant columns (`id` and unnamed index)
- Encoded categorical labels to numerical format
- Applied **StandardScaler** for feature normalization
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing

### Key Features Include:
- **Radius** - Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
- **Texture** - Standard deviation of gray-scale values
- **Perimeter** - Tumor perimeter measurement
- **Area** - Tumor area measurement
- **Smoothness** - Local variation in radius lengths
- **Compactness** - Perimeter¬≤ / area - 1.0
- **Concavity** - Severity of concave portions of the contour
- **Concave Points** - Number of concave portions of the contour
- **Symmetry** - Tumor symmetry measurement
- **Fractal Dimension** - "Coastline approximation" - 1

*Each feature includes mean, standard error, and worst (largest) values, resulting in 30 total features.*
